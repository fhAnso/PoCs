# Concrete CMS, 9.3.2 stored XSS (Authenticated) 

`Description`:
```txt
Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.2 are affected by a stored XSS 
vulnerability in the generate board instance functionality. The 
Name input field does not check the input sufficiently letting a rogue 
administrator have the capability to inject malicious JavaScript code. The Concrete 
CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a 
vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N and a CVSS v4 score of 1.8 with 
a vector of CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N 
```   

## PoC:
- `login` to the concretecms `dashboard` and navigate to:
```txt
index.php/dashboard/boards/instances/view/1
```  
- switch to the `Board Instances` tab and click `Generate`
- enter JavaScript payload in `Name` input field
- click `Create Instance` to generate the manipulated new instance
- the payload will be triggered every time the instance is loaded
